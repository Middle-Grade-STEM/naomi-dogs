<h1>Foods</h1>
<hr>
<p>One thing you should really be careful with is what you feed your dog. Some foods are highly nutritious to them, but some are deadly.
<br><br><br> Here are some foods that are great for your dog (sourced from the <a href="https://www.akc.org/" target=_blank> American Kennel Club</a>):<br><br> Fish-They contain good fats and amino acids, giving your dog a nice health boost. <br><br> Honey-is packed with countless nutrients such as vitamins A, B, C, D, E, and K, potassium, calcium, magnesium, copper, and antioxidants. Feeding dogs small amounts of honey can help with allergies because it introduces small amounts of pollen to their systems, building up immunity to allergens in your area.
<br> <br>Unsalted Peanut Butter-It contains heart-healthy fats, vitamins B and E and niacin. Make sure the peanut butter you are feeding to your
dog does not contain xylitol, a highly toxic sugar substitute to your dog.
<br><br> Wheats And Other Grains-Dogs do not have to be grain-free; it is perfectly OK for them to have grains. In fact, grains like wheat and corn are great sources of protein, essential fatty acids, and fiber.

<p>Some foods that should not be given to your dog: <br><br> Almonds-They can block the esophagus or even tear the windpipe if not chewed completely.
Salted almonds are especially dangerous because they can increase water retention, which is potentially fatal to dogs prone to heart disease.
<br><br> Cinnamon-While cinnamon is not actually toxic to dogs, it’s probably best to avoid it.
Cinnamon and its oils can irritate the inside of dogs’ mouths, making them uncomfortable and sick.
It can lower a dog’s blood sugar too much and can lead to diarrhea, vomiting, increased, or decreased
heart rate, and even liver disease. <br><br> Grapes-Grapes and raisins are known to be highly toxic to dogs,
though research has yet to pinpoint exactly which substance in the fruit causes this reaction.
Because of that, peeled or seedless grapes should also be avoided. They can cause vomiting and dehydration. </p>
