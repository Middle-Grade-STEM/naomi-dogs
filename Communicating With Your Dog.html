<h1>Communication With Your Dog</h1>

<hr>
<p>Communicating with your dog is not always easy. They can't speak English, and you can't speak barks. Here I have a few tips on what to say and do during certain
situations. </p>

<tr>
<th>Situation</th>
<th>What Not To Do</th>
<th>What To Do</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>When your dog ruins your belongings</td>
<td>Yell at them and physically hurt them after it had already happened.</td>
<td>Give them a firm and strong remark, and don't give any attention to them, signaling that you are unhappy with them, but only if
it is within a few seconds of them doing the action, or else they cannot interpret what you mean. After some time, they will understand to
not do the certain thing. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>When you dog pulls on the leash during a walk</td>
<td>Let your dog keep on pulling, and helplessly follow. This will result in your dog thinking that they can do whatever
they want, and that they are the leader.</td>
<td>Pull them back to you, pulling back in the opposite direction of where they are urging to go to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>When your dog is begging for food at the dinner table</td>
<td>Give them a piece of your tukey, because a slice of turkey never harmed a dog, right? This is not a great way to do things, as if you keep doing this,
 your dog will get used
to getting food from the table, and think that it is a need to get food from there. If you do not give them food after this pattern, they will likely
jump on the table or bark for food.</td>
<td>Make sure your dog does not get any food from the table, and if they do, make sure to put it in their own food bowl, since that is usually
the only place they should be eating from.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>When your dog does not want to go in their crate</td>
<td>Letting them sleep wherever they want, not having a designated place to go. This shows that you are giving in to them, which
will lower their respect for you.</td>
<td>Prove to them that their little nook is a fun, comforting place. Use treats to get them in, and when they are in there, give them lots of
things that they would like, such as toys and food, communicating that their pen or crate is a safe and fun space that they would enjoy staying in.</td>
